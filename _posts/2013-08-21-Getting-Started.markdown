Here are some helpful links for getting started. I have been using 2.9.0 but we can revaluate whent the schoolyear starts.

[Cordova Download] (http://cordova.apache.org/)



The platform guide explains everything from setting up the development environment to deploying the app on an emulator/phone.

[Android Platform Guide] (http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.9.0/guide_getting-started_android_index.md.html#Android%20Platform%20Guide)


To use JQuery Mobile you will also need JQuery.

[JQuery 2.0.3] (http://jquery.com/download/)



When downloading JQuery Mobile, download the zip file. It contains an images folder that you need to place inside the css folder of your app.

[JQuery Mobile 1.3] (http://jquerymobile.com/download/)


For an example on how to use JQuery Mobile and Cordova together, look at the Tic Tac Toe app on the WesApp github page or use google.
