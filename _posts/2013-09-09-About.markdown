Here is some background information and links to some more resources.


Hybrid Apps
-------------
Native apps are developed using the native IDE and SDK for their respective platforms. Mobile websites are websites are viewed through mobile phone browsers. Mobile web apps are web apps designed specifically for mobile phones for improved performance. Hybrid apps are developed using web technologies and wrapped in a native package so they can be distributed through app stores and installed on devices. The benefit of developing a hybrid app include faster development, one language can be used across multiple platforms, and access to native capabilities. The disadvantages include performance, making the app look native, and more time spent just making things work.


PhoneGap
--------------
PhoneGap is a mobile development framework for developing apps for mobile devices using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. A developer builds a web application for a mobile OS, then uploads the app to [PhoneGap Build] (https://build.phonegap.com/), which compiles the app for Android, iOS, webOS, Symbian, BlackBerry, and Windows Phone.  
When a PhoneGap app launches, it opens up a web view that displays the contents of the html file and passes control to the web view. The web app running in the web view has all the permissions of a normal web application that would run within a mobile browser, however it also has access to device features and hardware through PhoneGap's Javascript APIs, including accelerometer, camera, contacts, geolocatation, and storage.

jQuery Mobile
-------------------

jQuery Mobile is an html5 based user interface system built on jQuery and jQuery UI for iOS, Android, BlackBerry, Windows Phone, webOS, and Symbian. It provides buttons an animations for mobile devices that make a web app look "native".

jQuery Mobile works by using the html data- attribute to generate tags at runtime to style app.

Git
-------
Git is a distributed version control system. It manages changes to collections of information and allows multiple people to work on the same project.

Git is often used in conjunction with [GitHub] (https://github.com), a hosting service for software development projects using Git.
